        <h1>Hi, I'm Chen!</h1>
        <p>I'm a product designer, developer, and biologist at Brown. I'm a big fan of applying visualisation and kinetics to help give people a more intuitive idea of information.</p>
        <p>This summer, I was at Microsoft working on a product for the Microsoft Band. I also interned with IBM Watson in the spring. I led the design team for Hack@Brown last year. It's gotten some accolades.</p>
        <p>These days, I write, mentor, and figure out what I can squeeze into my portfolio without violating NDA.</p>
        <p>Hit me up, or check out my (very WIP) resume and/or portfolio.</p>
